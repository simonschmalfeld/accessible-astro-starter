            <p>
              We are a small studio that specializes in web design, product innovation, and emerging technologies. We
              can help you create a website for your business, design and develop an MVP for your startup, or explore
              the possibilities of AI and AR for your product. Our team is dedicated to providing high-quality services
              tailored to your needs.

          <AccordionItem name='exclusive' title='What differentiates you from classic dev agencies?'>
            <p>
              We are a small team of experts who are passionate about what we do. We focus on quality over quantity and
              work closely with our clients. We are not a body shop, but instead will join you during the entire
              process, from ideation to implementation. We are also committed to using the latest technologies and best
              practices to ensure that our solutions are not only functional but also accessible and user-friendly.

          <AccordionItem name='exclusive' title='How does the pricing work?'>
            <p>
              Usually we offer two options: an hourly rate or an equity model. The hourly rate is great for funded
              startups or established companies. The equity model is a great option for early stage startups that are
              looking for a partner to help them build their product. We are flexible and can work with you to find the
              best solution for your needs. When it comes to equity, we reserve the right to vet the project and the
              team before we start working together.

          <AccordionItem name='exclusive' title='Do you offer fixed price projects?'>
            <p>
              Due to the innovative and uncertain nature of our projects, we do not offer classic statements of work with fixed time, scope and budget. While we guarantee the highest quality in design and engineering craftsmanship, the scope of the project might change multiple times based on new market insights. Nevertheless, what we can offer are hourly packages with clearly defined goals, such as building a prototype or supporting a market launch.
